                        as I prepare to navigate the tech world for my first official role 
                        as a web developer. I, like this portfolio, will always be a work

                    <h2>Beginnings</h2>
                    <p>
                        I entered the workforce at the age of 14 as a volunteer receptionist
                        for an exotic avian boarding facility. Soon after that I was hired
                        at the same facility and so began my long lasting journey as some
                        mix between receptionist, administrative assistant, manager, etc.
                        I was <em>good </em>at this sort of work, so I kept going deeper.                        
                    </p>
                    <h2>Breaking Point</h2>
                    <p>
                        Later in life I realized I was no longer engaged in my work. It
                        was difficult to face the music, to realize that being good at
                        something didn't mean I enjoyed it, or wanted to continue on
                        this path. I had hit my peak and began searching for my passion.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Discovery</h2>
                    <p>
                        I began by reflecting on what I did and did not enjoy in past
                        positions. I then thought about what I wanted out of life and 
                        where my career fit in to those plans. Finally I assessed my skills to
                        determine which I was most interested in, which needed some work, 
                        and which I did not want to pursue.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Intro to Tech</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a few of my mixed-administrative roles I was given the opportunity
                        to work closely with various tech professionals. First, as a manager I oversaw the 
                        update of the company's website and worked directly with the developer
                        on SEO and design for the new site. Then as an office administrator I 
                        was thrown in to the deep-end of wordpress and asked to figure it out. Finally, as an administrative assistant I 
                        was tasked with working along side a DBA to update the departments Microsoft
                        Access Database features and functionality. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Revelation</h2>
                    <p>
                        These experiences stood out positively in my reflections. I realized
                        I was tired of supporting these roles, I instead wanted to be in one. 
                        Thus began my newly found passion and desire to break in 
                        to the wonderful world of computer science/tech/web development.
                    </p>
