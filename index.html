            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>
                I spend most days working on <a class="content-link" href="projects.html" target="_blank">projects</a> to hone and 
                enhance the skills in <a class="content-link" href="comingsoon.html" target="_blank">my toolbox.</a> I'm working on 
                documenting my journey and sharing my knowledge through 
                my <a class="content-link" href="comingsoon.html" target="_blank">blog</a> (coming soon), and am actively accepting freelance clients 
                as I prepare to navigate the tech world for my first official role 
                as a web developer. I, like this portfolio, will always be a work
                in progress. Don't hesitate to <a class="content-link" href="get-in-touch.html" target="_blank">get in touch!</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
                I entered the workforce at the age of 14 as a volunteer receptionist
                for an exotic avian boarding facility. Soon after that I was hired
                at the same facility and so began my long lasting journey as some
                mix between receptionist, administrative assistant, manager, etc.
                I was <em>good </em>at this sort of work, so I kept going deeper.                        
            </p>
            <h2>Breaking Point</h2>
            <p>
                Later in life I realized I was no longer engaged in my work. It
                was difficult to face the music, to realize that being good at
                something didn't mean I enjoyed it, or wanted to continue on
                this path. I had hit my peak and began searching for my passion.
            </p>
            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>
                I began by reflecting on what I did and did not enjoy in past
                positions. I then thought about what I wanted out of life and 
                where my career fit in to those plans. Finally I assessed my skills to
                determine which I was most interested in, which needed some work, 
                and which I did not want to pursue.
            </p>
            <h2>Intro to Tech</h2>
            <p>
                In a few of my mixed-administrative roles I was given the opportunity
                to work closely with various tech professionals. First, as a manager I oversaw the 
                update of the company's website and worked directly with the developer
                on SEO and design for the new site. Then as an office administrator I 
                was thrown in to the deep-end of wordpress and asked to figure it out. Finally, as an administrative assistant I 
                was tasked with working along side a DBA to update the departments Microsoft
                Access Database features and functionality. 
            </p>
            <h2>Revelation</h2>
            <p>
                These experiences stood out positively in my reflections. I realized
                I was tired of supporting these roles, I instead wanted to be in one. 
                Thus began my newly found passion and desire to break in 
                to the wonderful world of computer science/tech/web development.
            </p>
